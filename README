This is a Coq proof of strong normalization for a rewrite system that
corresponds to a Nested Relational Calculus, ultimately in service of showing
that all NRC expressions with flat output type can be compiled to SQL.

The formalization uses de Bruijn indices, widely known as a poor
representation, but it was the only binder-encoding that I fully understood
when I first started this project. I'd like to see if anything is made
significantly simpler by switching to a locally-nameless representation.
