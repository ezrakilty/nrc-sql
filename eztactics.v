(* From Benjamin Pierce:
   "A similar annoyance arises in situations where the context contains
   a contradictory assumption and we want to use [inversion] on it to
   solve the goal.  We'd like to be able to say to Coq, "find a
   contradictory assumption and invert it" without giving its name
   explicitly.

   Unfortunately (and a bit surprisingly), Coq does not provide a
   built-in tactic that does this.  However, it is not too hard to
   define one ourselves.  (Thanks to Aaron Bohannon for this nice
   hack.)" *)
